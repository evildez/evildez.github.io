# Watson & Sherlock

This proyect had the main objective of applying certain HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge to build a simple _display_ page.

It also served the purpose of a nice gift to my girlfriend.

### HTML Markdown

> Simple yet usefull HTML markdown language was used to build the basic infrastructure of the website.

### CSS Framework

> This proyect serves as an initiative to build my own framework. A task yet to be started, but clearly in the works.

### JavaScript Coding

> First time of really using JavaScript in a integrated way with HTML and CSS. Looking forward to use some kind of **JSP** in the future.

### Thoughts & Observations

This proyect had a great impact on me getting started with the usage of `git` commands, such ass:

- `git init`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Commit Message"`
- `git push -u origin master`

Also, it popped a massive creative inflow for my personal proyects. I hope it really pays off getting started with this kind of _basic_ konwledge on `git` and other types of programmng languages.
